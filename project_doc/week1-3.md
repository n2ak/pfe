# Done so far:
- Lane line detection :
    * Selection of ROI.
    * cv2 Canny for edge detection.
    * cv2 threshold for color filtering.
    * cv2 HoughLines for line detection.

- Real time visualization.
- Class/Api that contains all the functionalities.


# Obstacles/Problems:
- ROI polygon depends on a lot of factors (Camera position...).
