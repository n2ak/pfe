    This method can be divided into three categories: 
    * the method of using background subtraction
    * the method of using continuous video frame difference
    * and the method of using optical flow
    
    Using the video frame difference method, the variance is calculated according to the pixel values of two or three consecutive video frames

    Vehicle detection methods using vehicle features, such as the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) methods, have been widely used
